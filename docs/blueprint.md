## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#64B5F6), providing a calm, musical tone. It suggests trust and dependability for your audio library. It is a harmonious color with good recognition, and is far enough away from the forbidden Teal to be distinctive.
- Background color: Almost white (#F0F7FF) - this very light blue is consistent in hue with the primary color, contributing to a light and airy overall effect
- Accent color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF), for interactive elements to highlight selectable items or currently playing media.  The color will stand out from the rest of the UI, but is not so different as to feel out of place.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif), giving the app a modern, objective, and neutral feel for easy readability.
- Smooth transitions between screens and animated progress bars during music playback.
